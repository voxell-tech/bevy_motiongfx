**MotionGfx** is a backend-agnostic motion graphics framework. It
provides a modular foundation for procedural animations.

## Key Features

- **Backend agnostic**: Works with any rendering backend.
- **Procedural**: Write animations with code - loops, functions,
  logic.
- **Type-erased**: Powered by
  [Field Path](https://github.com/voxell-tech/field_path) &
  [Typarena](https://github.com/voxell-tech/typarena), allowing
  runtime-flexible animation of arbitrary data.
- **Two-way playback**: Play animations both forward and backward with
  no extra computation.
- **Batteries included**: Packed with common easing and interpolation
  functions.

## Quick Start

```rust
use motiongfx::prelude::*;

// A world is where you hold all your animatable subjects.
struct World(Vec<f32>);

// Teach `motiongfx` how to read and write `f32` subjects from `World`.
impl SubjectSource<usize, f32> for World {
    fn get_source(&self, id: usize) -> Option<&f32> {
        self.0.get(id)
    }

    fn apply_source<R>(
        &mut self,
        id: usize,
        f: impl FnOnce(&mut f32) -> R,
    ) -> Option<R> {
        self.0.get_mut(id).map(f)
    }
}

let mut world = World(vec![0.0]);

// The registry tracks which types are animated.
let mut registry = Registry::new();
// The builder is typed on the world.
let mut b = registry.create_builder::<World>();

let id = 0;
// Create an action with: id, field path, action fn.
// Animate subject 0 from its current value to +10.0.
let action = b.act(id, path!(<f32>), |x| x + 10.0);

// "Play" the action into a `TrackFragment` with a duration.
let frag = action.play(s(1));

// Compile into a `Track`
// See "Track Ordering" section for composing fragments.
let track = frag.compile();

let mut timeline = b.compile(track);

// Bake must run once before sampling.
timeline.bake_actions(&registry, &world);

// Sample at t = 0.5, world.0[0] should now be 5.0.
timeline.set_target_time(cs(50));
timeline.queue_actions();
timeline.sample_queued_actions(&registry, &mut world);

assert!((world.0[0] - 5.0).abs() < f32::EPSILON);
```

## Creating your first animation

### The World

Think of a **world** as a container for everything you want to
animate. Each item inside it (called a **subject**) has an ID so
`motiongfx` can find it. To connect your world to `motiongfx`,
implement `SubjectSource` with two methods: one to read a subject by
ID, and one to write to it.

Because of Rust's orphan rule, `SubjectSource` must be implemented on
a type local to your crate. If you cannot own the type directly, wrap
it in a newtype.

```rust
# use motiongfx::prelude::*;
// Own your world so you can impl SubjectSource on it.
// Each f32 value is a subject, accessed by its index.
struct World(Vec<f32>);

impl SubjectSource<usize, f32> for World {
    fn get_source(&self, id: usize) -> Option<&f32> {
        self.0.get(id)
    }

    fn apply_source<R>(
        &mut self,
        id: usize,
        f: impl FnOnce(&mut f32) -> R,
    ) -> Option<R> {
        self.0.get_mut(id).map(f)
    }
}
```


### The Registry

The `Registry` keeps track of how to animate your types behind the
scenes. `motiongfx` is type-erased at runtime, so it needs the
registry to know how to read and write each field. You don't need to
set it up manually, just create one and pass it to the builder.
Registration happens automatically the first time you add an
animation.

```rust
# use motiongfx::prelude::*;
let mut registry = Registry::new();
```

### The Timeline Builder

The `TimelineBuilder` is where you describe your animations. Create
one from the registry, typed to your data holder:

```rust
# use motiongfx::prelude::*;
# let mut registry = Registry::new();
# type World = Vec<f32>;
let mut b = registry.create_builder::<World>();
```

### Building the Timeline

Animations are built up in layers:

1. An **action** says what to animate and how to transform it.
2. A **track fragment** gives the action a duration by calling `.play(duration)`.
3. A **track** is one or more fragments compiled together. You can
   order fragments before compiling (see [Track Ordering](#track-ordering)).
4. A **timeline** combines all your tracks into one playable sequence.

```rust
# #[path = "docs/world.rs"] mod _doc; use _doc::*;
# let mut registry = Registry::new();
# let mut b = registry.create_builder::<World>();
# let mut world = World(vec![0.0]);
let id = 0;
// Act: animate subject 0 from its current value to +10.0.
let action = b
    .act(id, path!(<f32>), |x| x + 10.0)
    // An optional easing function can be added.
    .with_ease(ease::cubic::ease_in_out);

// Play: turn the action into a fragment with a 1-second duration.
let frag = action.play(s(1));

// Compile the fragment into a Track.
let track = frag.compile();

// Add the track and compile into a Timeline.
let timeline = b.compile(track);
```

### Bake and Sample

Before playing an animation, you need to **bake** it. Baking reads
the starting values from your world and prepares the animation data.
This only needs to happen once, right after building the timeline.

To advance the animation, set a target time, then **queue** and
**sample**. Queuing figures out which actions are active at that
time, and sampling writes the new values back into your world.

A timeline can also have multiple tracks, each acting as a chapter.
Use `set_target_track` to jump between them.

```rust
# #[path = "docs/world.rs"] mod _doc; use _doc::*;
# let mut subjects = World(vec![0.0]);
# let (registry, mut timeline) = timeline();
// Bake once after building the timeline.
timeline.bake_actions(&registry, &subjects);

// Set target time, queue, then sample.
timeline.set_target_time(cs(50));
timeline.queue_actions();
timeline.sample_queued_actions(&registry, &mut subjects);

assert!((subjects.0[0] - 5.0).abs() < f32::EPSILON);
```

### Track Ordering

You can control how fragments play relative to each other. There are
4 ordering combinators:

#### 1. Chain

```rust
use motiongfx::prelude::*;

// Using empty fragments as an example only.
let f0 = TrackFragment::new();
let f1 = TrackFragment::new();

let f = [f0, f1].ord_chain();
// Or...
// use motiongfx::track::chain;
// let f = chain([f0, f1]);
```

`f1` plays after `f0` finishes.

#### 2. All

```rust
use motiongfx::prelude::*;

let f0 = TrackFragment::new();
let f1 = TrackFragment::new();

let f = [f0, f1].ord_all();
```

`f0` and `f1` play at the same time, and the result finishes when
both are done.

#### 3. Any

```rust
use motiongfx::prelude::*;

let f0 = TrackFragment::new();
let f1 = TrackFragment::new();

let f = [f0, f1].ord_any();
```

`f0` and `f1` play at the same time, and the result finishes when
either one is done.

#### 4. Flow

```rust
use motiongfx::prelude::*;

let f0 = TrackFragment::new();
let f1 = TrackFragment::new();

let f = [f0, f1].ord_flow(cs(50));
```

`f1` starts 0.5 seconds after `f0` begins, regardless of how long
`f0` takes.
